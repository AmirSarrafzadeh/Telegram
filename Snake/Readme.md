# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented using Pygame. In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen, eating blue circles and green rectangles to increase its score. The snake must avoid colliding with the red square (a bomb) and the walls of the screen.

## Features

- **Snake**: Black in color.
- **Blue Circles**: Randomly placed on the screen. Each circle increases the score by 1 when eaten by the snake.
- **Green Rectangle**: Randomly placed on the screen. Increases the score by 3 and resets the positions of the red and green squares when eaten.
- **Red Square (Bomb)**: Randomly placed on the screen. The game ends if the snake collides with it.
- **Game Over**: The game ends and restarts if the snake collides with the walls or the red square. The score is displayed on the screen.
